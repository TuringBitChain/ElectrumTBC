**Describe the problem**
Replace these words with a clear concise description of what the problem is. If you refer to something as crashing or freezing, we will not know what you are talking about. Example: "When I enter my wallet password the OK button stays grey and will not let me click on it."

**To Reproduce**
Replace the following steps with what you did to get the problem. Just saying things like "screen freezes" or "application crashes" means you're not giving us any detail and we may as well close the issue. Write the steps that we need to do to make the thing you described above happen.

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
Replace the following with a clear and concise description of what you wanted to do, but where what happened above happened instead.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. We recommend screenshots as often we have no idea what people are saying because they are too vague or ambiguous.
