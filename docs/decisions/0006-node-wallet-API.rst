Node wallet API
###############

:Date: 2022-11-09
:Status: Pending.

Context
-------

People use the node wallet and it's JSON-RPC API. As blocks become bigger and running a node
is more and more problematic just to have a wallet.

Decision
--------

We will provide as compatible a replacement for the node wallet API as is reasonable. This will
provide node wallet users with a viable option to move to, and make it easier for businesses and
users who were using it to continue moving forward on Bitcoin SV.

Consequences
------------

- We divert development resources from other more pressing forward looking tasks.
- We add extra workload maintaining and supporting this additional system.
