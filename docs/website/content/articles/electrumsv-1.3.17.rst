The main changes in this release have been listed below. If you donâ€™t want to know the details,
just read the titles. If you want to find out about smaller fixes, you can check the

Github repository.

Important: Browser root certificate revoked
===========================================

Due to the packages we depend on, we bundle the root certificates that are used
to verify that when we connect to a web site it is the legitimate web site. These have been
updated again with another root certificate has been revoked

Critical: Fix bug connecting to servers
=======================================

If you are experiencing this, the ElectrumSV networking status will continue to show
"Not connected" and will never change. If you start seeing it, you have to change a configuration
file to block a bad server - something so complicated no-one should ever have to do it ideally!
Which is why we are making this release.

ElectrumSV, like Electrum Core and Electron Cash before it, attempts to maintain connections to up
to 10 servers. The idea is that by doing so it can have a better overview of the correct state of
the blockchain and can follow a server that is working correctly. This has worked for all these
wallets for upwards of ten years.

The servers that ElectrumSV builds in for users to start with, are the ones we have vetted. But
this is not the only way that Electrum wallets find out about more servers to use, new servers
that start up gossip with existing servers and the existing servers tell connected ElectrumSV
wallets about the new servers.

A defective server appeared and went away. It returns a buggy result that breaks server connection
and causes the networking code to exit and prevent any server connections until ElectrumSV is
restarted. Unfortunately, anyone running ElectrumSV when it was around had this server added
to their server list as a possible server to check. When their copy of ElectrumSV starts up
it will attempt to connect to this defective server and it will return a result that causes this
problem.

This fix makes our server connection code more resilient and will remove the problem where a
server that is defective like this can break the network connection code.
