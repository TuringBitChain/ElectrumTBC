        <ul>
            <li>A defective server appeared and went away. It returns a buggy result that breaks server connection
and causes the networking code to exit and prevent any server connections until ElectrumSV is
restarted. Unfortunately, anyone running ElectrumSV when it was around had this server added
to their server list as a possible server to check. When their copy of ElectrumSV starts up
it will attempt to connect to this defective server and it will return a result that causes this
problem. This fix makes our server connection code more resilient and will remove the problem where a
server that is defective like this can break the network connection code.</li>
